## Getting Started

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll see how to create a UI starter project using a [giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/)
template which uses ESW-TS library. You can use this as a starting point for your own UI applications.

## Installation

`node` is mandatory to be installed on a machine for using ESW-TS. To install the latest version of node, visit the
[official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Create starter project

It is recommended to use Giter8 template `esw-ui-template.g8` to get started with building web application.
Follow [readme.md](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/esw-ui-template.g8/blob/master/README.md) for more details on how to
use the template to create starter project. `ESW-TS` comes pre-packaged as a dependency in the template.

If you already have a UI application and want to add ESW-TS dependency, then

To install the latest version of ESW-TS from npm

`npm install @tmtsoftware/esw-ts`

Or, to install a specific version

`npm install @tmtsoftware/esw-ts@{version}`
